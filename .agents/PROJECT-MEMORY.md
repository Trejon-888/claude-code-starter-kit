# Project Memory

**Institutional knowledge that persists across sessions.**

This file captures decisions, solved problems, and lessons learned so you never re-investigate the same issue twice. Claude reads this at every session start.

## Architecture Decisions

| # | Decision | Date | Rationale | Supersedes |
|---|----------|------|-----------|------------|
| <!-- ADR-001 --> | <!-- What was decided --> | <!-- YYYY-MM-DD --> | <!-- Why --> | <!-- Previous approach, if any --> |

## Problems Solved

<!-- When you fix a non-obvious bug, document the root cause and solution here. -->
<!-- Next time the same class of problem appears, Claude will find it immediately. -->

### General

| Problem | Root Cause | Solution | Session |
|---------|-----------|----------|---------|

## Breaking Changes

## Superseded Patterns
